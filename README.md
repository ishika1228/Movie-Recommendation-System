Movie Recommendation System 🎬

🚀 A Movie Recommendation System built using Machine Learning techniques to provide personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences.

📌 Overview
This project utilizes Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to recommend movies based on users' viewing history and movie metadata. It is implemented in Google Colab and supports scalable recommendations.

🔥 Features
✅ Personalized Movie Recommendations
✅ Collaborative Filtering (User-Based & Item-Based)
✅ Content-Based Filtering (Movie Metadata)
✅ Hybrid Recommendation Model
✅ Scalable for Large Datasets

🛠 Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python 🐍
Libraries:
pandas, numpy - Data handling
scikit-learn - Machine Learning
surprise - Recommendation algorithms
matplotlib, seaborn - Data visualization
📂 Dataset
Dataset Used: MovieLens Dataset
The dataset includes user ratings, movie details, and metadata.
⚙️ Setup & Installation

🎯 How It Works?
🔹 Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on similar users’ preferences.
🔹 Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies with similar metadata (genre, actors, etc.).
🔹 Hybrid Model: Combines both techniques for better accuracy.
